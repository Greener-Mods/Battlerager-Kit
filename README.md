# Battlerager-Kit
Battlerager Kit for Baldur's Gate Enhanced Edition

BATTLERAGER: The Battlerager fills a particular niche in dwarf society and culture. He is a fearless warrior, able to create an insane rage within himself which increases his fighting ability and distorts his physical features. While enraged, a Battlerager’s face becomes twisted and his teeth grind together. Spittle flies from his mouth and dribbles down his beard. His eyes enlarge, bulge, and become bloodshot. Size increases as his muscles swell and his body expands. His fighting ability becomes awesome, allowing him to fight longer and harder than any other dwarf. While in his rage, he is almost unstoppable. A dangerous enemy, he is a menace to friend and foe alike. 

Advantages:
– May use Killing Rage ability once per day. Gains one use at level 1 and an additional use every 4 levels thereafter.

RAGE: For 1 turn, the Battlerager gains a +1 to hit, +3 to damage, +10 temporary Hit Points, +2 movement rate and becomes immune to blindness, charm, confusion, death magic, fear, feeblemind, hold, sleep, stun and related effects. During this time, the Battlerager is unaware of <PRO_HISHER> current Hit Points and is temporarily unaffected by any effect that heals Hit Points. After the rage subsides <PRO_HESHE> becomes fatigued and <PRO_HISHER> Strength drops for 1 turn.

Disadvantages:
– Race restricted to dwarf.
– May not use missile weapons.
– Alignment restricted to any non-lawful.
